# Welcome to 21 Blackjack #
* An App using Ruby, Sinatra, jQuery/Ajax, HTML, CSS - based on the gotealeaf.com tutorial *


### Instructions for App ##

1. Make sure the 'sinatra' gem is installed.
2. From the command line, you can start the server by 'ruby main.rb'
3. If you have the 'shotgun' gem installed, you can instead run 'shotgun main.rb'
4. ctrl+c to stop the server


*Things to fix*
- When no bet money is left (=0), display error message accordingly, not "Bet amount cannot be greater than what you have ($0)"
